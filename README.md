## Features
- **Responsive Design:** We ensure our platform adjusts flawlessly to various screens, promising a smooth and enjoyable user experience across different devices.
- **State Management with Redux Toolkit:** Redux Toolkit is utilized for efficient state management across the application, providing a streamlined development experience.
- **User Authentication:** We employ Context API exclusively for authentication-related operations. By default, users are directed to their intended page upon successful login; otherwise, they are redirected to a custom page.
- **Error handle in authentication:** Effective error handling during login and signup involves clear messages, input validation, try-catch blocks, network error management, logging, and fallback options for seamless user experience.
- **Product Search:** Users effortlessly locate products by searching product names, enhancing navigation and accessibility within the application.
- **Shopping Cart:** Users conveniently customize product quantities, edit directly in the cart, and remove items, ensuring a tailored and flexible shopping experience.
- **Checkout:** Users seamlessly place orders, accessing detailed order information on the orders page for a smooth and transparent transaction experience.
